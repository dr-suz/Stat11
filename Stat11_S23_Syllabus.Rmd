# Course Description 

STAT 11 prepares students to think statistically and to be able to perform basic statistical analyses using the statistical software package R. Topics include exploratory data analysis, design of surveys and experiments, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, and an introduction to linear regression. Applications will be drawn from interdisciplinary case studies spanning the humanities, social sciences, public policy, medicine, and the sciences. This course is intended for students who want a practical introduction to statistical methods. 

## Textbook 

We will be using the 5th edition of [Stats: Data and Models](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/stats-data-and-models/P200000006160/9780136880790).You are required to have access to Pearson's MyLab. You can purchase an 18 week access package through the campus bookstore.  The following details this package.

## Other Required Course Items 

We will also use the MyLab Statistics that accompanies our Pearson eText. Links to this lab will be provided on our course Moodle page. You will also work with software to perform statistical analyses in this class. You may use either Excel (or Google sheets) or RStudio. 

If you wish to use RStudio, you may access [Swarthmore's RStudio Server](https://rstudio.swarthmore.edu/) through your browser (this requires internet access and Swarthmore VPN if off-campus). Alternatively you may download the software to run RStudio on your personal computer (this does not require internet access but can be a bit of a headache). To do so, first download the [base software R](https://www.r-project.org/). Then, once you have completed that installation of base R, you can download the [RStudio user interface](https://www.rstudio.com/).	 

## Intro to R Workshop

A two-part workshop designed and led by our Stat clinicians will introduce students to R statistical computing.  Although geared toward students enrolled in Stat 11 or Stat 21, anyone with an interest in learning R is welcome to attend.  Each workshop will include instruction from 8-9 pm and an optional Q&A time from 9-10 pm.  

### Part 1

* Wednesday January 18 in SC 104 

* Thursday January 19 in SC 104

### Part 2

* Sunday January 22 in SC 105 

* Tuesday January 24 in SC 105



# Learning Objectives 


Upon successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:

* Understand how to properly collect and organize quantifiable information in the form of data;
* Choose an appropriate statistical analysis and/or graphic for different data types;
* Apply statistical analysis methods using software (RStudio, Excel, or other) and interpret these results within the context of the data;
* Critically examine (identify strengths and weaknesses of) exploratory analyses of data and applications of common inferential methods in quantitative reports.   


# Course Components 

## Class Meetings 

There are three course meetings per week and attendance is mandatory. Course meetings will combine: statistical knowledge and applied examples, applications using R, and in-class exercises/discussions. To be best prepared for class please bring with you a laptop and a note-taking device. Please don’t be a distraction to those around you. If you do not have access to a laptop, tell your professor who can arrange for you to borrow one. The textbook is meant to serve as an accompaniment to your in-class notes and you are expected to prepare for class by reading the assigned chapters. 


## Practice Items 

### Individual Homework 

Each week, you will be assigned homework practice problems to be completed in the Pearson myLab that accompanies your textbook. These assignments are meant to be completed by yourself alone to practice your own understanding of the topics we cover in class and in your textbook. Your homework grade for these assignments is entirely based upon your completion of the assignments. These assignments are due on the day of our final exam. Do not wait until the end of the semester to get started on these. No extensions whatsoever will be given for the individual homework assignments.

### Group Homework 

Over the semester, you will be assigned $5$ data-analysis homework problem sets that will each be graded for correctness. You are encouraged to work with one another one these homework assignments although each student must hand in their own copy of the solutions. You may use either Excel or RStudio to analyze the data in these assignments. We may occasionally use class time to work on some of these assignments. Your group homework grade will be the average of all $5$ assignments. No late group homework assignments will be accepted. 

## Assessment Items 

### Quizzes

There will be three in-class quizzes emphasizing the most recent material covered in class. These quizzes are closed book but you may be permitted to use a handwritten "cheat sheet" according to specifications set forth by your professor. If you have a scheduling conflict due to a religious holiday or travel plans on a quiz day, you must let me know at least **two weeks** ahead of time. Otherwise, **no make-up quizzes** will be permitted. 

### Final Exam 

The final exam will take place during the finals period <span style="color:red">(exact time/day TBD)</span> and it will be cumulative. The exam schedule will be posted by the registrar once it is determined. Do not schedule any travel plans during finals week as makeups will not be permitted  for the final exam. 

### Final Project

There will be one group project that will be presented on the last week of class. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience collecting and analyzing data. You will have the option to be assigned to a group or to work with your own group.  




# Course Policies 

## Course Grade 

Your entire course grade is determined by each course component listed above. Note that this includes your attendance in class. If there are no penalties accrued from unexcused absences then homework assignments will account for $25\%$ of your overall grade (individual assignments count for $15\%$ and group assignments count for $10\%$), each of the three in-class quizzes will account for $10\%$ of your overall course grade, your group final project will account for $25\%$ of your overall course grade, and the final exam will account for $20\%$ of your overall course grade. 

## Attendance

Your attendance in class is mandatory. Occasionally, your professor will record classroom attendance. After your second unexcused absence, your course grade will be penalized $1\%$ point for each subsequent unexcused absence. The way to determine if an absence is excused is by communicating with your professor. 

## Academic Integrity 

Statistics is a powerful tool for scientific discovery and communication. Statistics instructors play an important role in equipping new practitioners with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to practice statistics ethically and transparently. As such, it is your professor's duty to provide you with an honest, accurate assessment of your current abilities throughout the semester. Your assessments (and grades) are designed to inform you so you are confident about what you have mastered and so you can pinpoint where you have the most room for growth and improvement. Your grades do not determine your future success in statistics nor are they reflective of your general intelligence. Nevertheless, your grades provide indispensable feedback that is integral towards supporting the widespread practice of ethical, transparent, and reproducible statistics. Therefore, **it is your duty to hold yourself to the highest standards of academic integrity**. 

Quizzes and exams must be completed by yourself without communicating to others and all work must be your own. Cheating, copying, etc. will not be tolerated. Upon the first offense, all parties involved will receive a zero grade and must schedule a subsequent in-person meeting with your professor. Failure to meet with your professor within two weeks of the offense will result in having your case filed with the College Judiciary Committee. Upon a second offense, a case will be filed with the College Judiciary Committee for all parties involved. If you are unsure of whether or not your actions are complying with the assignment/quiz/exam instructions,  ask for clarification. If you are feeling desperate enough to consider cheating, contact your professor and explain what is going on so you can get additional support. 

## Inclusion and Respect 

We all come to class with different backgrounds and experiences and this diversity of thought and perspective will enrich our learning environment. Respect for one another’s identities and contributions to class discussions is mandatory. This includes attempting to avoid using diminutive language that is not uncommon to hear within other mathematics settings. Although you may hear phrases such as \"that's trivial\", \"it's obvious that\", \"clearly...\", or \"it's intuitive that\" in many math and statistics courses, your professor makes a conscious effort to avoid this language in her lectures and she expects you to avoid using this language in her classroom too. What is obvious to one person could be another person's PhD thesis and what is "intuitive" is entirely subject to one's own experiences. These efforts from you and your professor will help maintain a supportive learning environment where everyone feels comfortable participating and questions are encouraged and not looked down upon.  

## Course feedback

Your professor will solicit explicit feedback from you twice throughout the semester. Each time, the feedback forms will be identical and anonymous. The first time your feedback is requested will be about halfway through the semester. Your feedback here helps your professor identify what is and isn't working for you and to make reasonable adjustments accordingly. The last time your professor requests your feedback is at the end of the semester. You are welcome to submit feedback before or after the final exam. This feedback helps your professor prepare for and improve upon future sessions of this course. 

As you may know, this type of feedback, although informative, is heavily biased. Not only is volunteer response bias inevitable, there are studies that indicate strong emotional and social biases influence course evaluations based on identity factors such as the instructor's race, gender, sexuality, and age and based on external factors that influence respondents' emotions related to the course material. (See, for example [1] and [2], among others.) You may wish to read over [this quick guide on how to avoid bias in your course evaluation responses](https://kalilajo.github.io/Teaching/BiasInCourseEvals.pdf).


If you find that you have more feedback and ideas that you'd like to share with the department at large, please consider joining one of the Math/Stat department student groups. Currently these groups consist of Gender Minorities in Math/Stat (GeMS), Black in Math/Stat (BIMS), and the Math/Stat Student Advisory Council (MSSAC). Participation in these groups is a great way to communicate with the Math/Stat faculty and staff directly as we work together to build a more equitable learning environment for all students. Feel free to ask your professor about how to get involved! 


# Additional Resources 

## Office Hours 

Office hours are located in SCI 136. The dates and times will be determined after the start of class. 

You are expected to attend office hours as often as you need. If you are unable to attend your professor's regular office hours due to academic scheduling conflicts, you may contact her  to arrange another time to meet.

During office hours, your professor will try to make sure that everyone who shows up gets a chance to ask a question. Typically, student questions are prioritized according to whoever arrives first but sometimes your professor may prioritize questions that are shared by more than one student. When it’s your turn to ask a question, please limit yourself to only one question (even if it is a question with a very short answer). Once everyone present has gotten a chance to ask their question, you will get the opportunity to ask another question. When others are asking questions, pay attention because you might learn something from the discussion.  

## Stat Clinic Hours 

Stat 11 Clinics will be held on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights in SC 105 from 7-10 pm and are exclusively for students enrolled in Stat 11.  These study sessions are a wonderful opportunity to study, do homework, meet and work with classmates, and ask questions about statistics.  Because study sessions are drop-in, you are welcome to come and go as you please.   Please write your name and course in the sign-in binder and the time you enter and leave the clinic so the Math/Stat Department has a record of your attendance.  To make the most of your time at study sessions, be sure to first try problems on your own, or bring questions you have from your text or lecture.  Having your textbook, lecture notes and online resources handy is essential because these are helpful resources for both you and the Clinician working with you.  There will likely be other students at study sessions with questions for the Clinicians, so do not expect to get individual attention the entire time you are there.  Be open to working on other problems, thinking about and trying to work through the question you have for the Clinicians, working with classmates, or doing other coursework while you wait to speak with the Clinician.  

|Stat 11 Clinic |SC 105 from 7-10pm |
|--------|------|
| Su | Anne French and Felicia Yi | 
| M | Quinn Basewitz and Joyce Ben |
| Tu | Lizbeth Zarate-Hernandez and Leia Donoway |

In addition to the course specific Clinics for Stat 11, you are welcome to attend the general Stat Clinic nights 7-10 pm on Sunday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights in SC 104.  Utilizing the general Stat Clinic is similar to making use of Stat 11 Clinic, but there may be students from different courses in attendance as well.  For questions about the Stat 11 Clinic and the general Stat Clinic please visit https://www.swarthmore.edu/mathematics-statistics/math-and-stat-clinic-study-sessions  or contact Laura Dandridge ldandri1@swarthmore.edu,  Academic Support Coordinator for the Math/Stat Department. Laura also has office hours to directly support students working on Stat 11  material, and you may sign up for an appointment on WASE.

## Accommodations 

Your professor will not provide individual accommodations unless you provide her with proof of registration with Student Disability Services (SDS). Accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive.

If you believe you need accommodations for a disability or a chronic medical condition, you may contact SDS via email at studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu to arrange an appointment to discuss your needs. As appropriate, the office will issue students with documented disabilities or medical conditions a formal Accommodations Letter. For details about the accommodations process, visit the [Student Disability Services website](https://www.swarthmore.edu/office-academic-success/welcome-to-student-disability-services).  

## Counseling and Pschological Services 

Swarthmore provides support to students who are experiencing academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or depression through the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). If you or someone you know needs support please call 610-328-7768 to speak with a licensed counselor at any time or visit the [CAPS website](https://www.swarthmore.edu/counseling-and-psychological-services) to schedule an appointment.


Part of why it is important to your professor to maintain an inclusive and respectful classroom is because it's incredibly difficult to "do math" under stress. For example, give [this game](https://www.tomscott.com/usvsth3m/maths/) a try! If you are experience stress inside the classroom, your professor is here to help you. If you are experiencing stress outside the classroom, CAPS is here to help you.

### Title IX 

Please be aware that all faculty are “responsible employees”, which means that if you a professor about a situation involving sexual harassment or assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, they must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. Although professors are responsible for this notification, you have complete control over how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to meet with the Title IX coordinator or pursue a formal complaint.
