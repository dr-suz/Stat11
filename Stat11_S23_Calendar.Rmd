We will cover three different, but related, units in this one-semester course. These units roughly correspond to the first six parts of your textbook. The units are broken into the following subject areas:


**Unit 1**

- Exploring and understanding data 
- Exploring and understanding relationships between variables 



**Unit 2**

- Collecting data 
- Randomness and probability


**Unit 3**

- Statistical inference from a single sample of data 
- Statistical inference from multiple samples of data 
- Statistical inference for related variables 

<br><br>

**Office Hours** 

Held in SCI 136 on **M W 4-5pm** and **F 1:30-2:30pm**.
