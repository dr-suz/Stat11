$$\frac{25+29}{26+16+25+29+16+29}= 0.383$$

or, equivalently, 

$$\frac{\frac{25+29}{16+25+16+16+29+16+26+16+25+29+16+29}}{\frac{26+16+25+29+16+29}{16+25+16+16+29+16+26+16+25+29+16+29}}$$

Let $A=$ eat breakfast and $B=$ floss teeth. Then $Pr(A) = 0.57$, $Pr(B)=0.80$, and $Pr(A\text{ and }B) = 0.46$.

Hence, $Pr(A\text{ or }B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A\text{ and }B) = 0.57 + 0.80 - 0.46 = 0.91$

Let $A=$ ticket for speeding and $B=$ ticket for running red light. Then $Pr(A\text{ and }B) = 0.04$, $Pr(A)=0.12$, and $Pr(B) = 0.09$.

Since $Pr(A \text{ and } B^C) + Pr(A \text{ and }B) = Pr(A)$, we have that $Pr(A\text{ and }B^C) = 0.12 -0.04 =0.08$.

Assuming independence means either: 

$$Pr(\text{Yes HD} \mid \text{Yes Mu})= Pr(\text{Yes HD})$$
i.e.$\frac{x}{30} = \frac{80}{120}$ meaning $x=20$, or, equivalently 

$$Pr(\text{Yes HD and Yes Mu}) = Pr(\text{Yes HD})Pr(\text{YesMu})$$
i.e. $\frac{x}{120} = \frac{30}{120} \cdot \frac{80}{120}$ meaning $x=20$.

# 15 

* $E(X) = 3(0.1) + 4(0.25) + 5(0.55) + 6(0.1) = 4.65$

* $Var(X) = (3-E(X))^2(0.1) + (4-E(X))^2(0.25) + (5-E(X))^2(0.55) + (6-E(X))^2(0.1) = 0.6284$

* question actually meant that the distribution is for 1 hour shifts and the question asks about 8hr days... so really need to compute $E(8X)$ and $Var(8X)$.... but not grading this way b/c I asked specifically for $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$ 


## Rubric

* 0.1 - found $E(8X)$ and $Var(8X)$  

* ... 

* 0.5 - correct expectation 

* ? - correct expectation but no work 

* 0.5 - correct variance 

* ? - correct variance but no work 

* 0.4 - correct variance given incorrect expectation

* ? - answer attempted but incorrect

$X \sim N(5, 2^2)$ so $Pr(X \leq 3.5) = Pr\left(Z \leq \frac{3.5-5}{2} \right) = Pr(Z \leq -0.75) = 0.227$

(give most credit for work, little credit for correct reading of the Z table (since this involves some calculation work))

$X \sim Binom(5, 0.65)$ and we want to find $Pr(X \leq 2) = Pr(X=0) + Pr(X=1) + Pr(X=2) =0.235$

must display correct usage of binomial table
