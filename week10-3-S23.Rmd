# Recap and corrections

Once you have finished the assigned reading for this week, please take a look at this [reference sheet for confidence intervals](https://profsuzy.github.io/Stat11/Cheat-sheet-4.html). It has been uploaded to our Moodle page. 

## CIs for a population proportion/probability of success

### Find a critical value for a 95% CI in R 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
qnorm((1-0.95)/2, 0, 1)
```

### Find a critical value for a 95% CI in Excel 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
NORM.INV((1-0.95)/2, 0, 1)
```

### Find a critical value for a 95% CI from a table of probabilities 

Using a [Standard Normal Z Table](https://profsuzy.github.io/Stat11/Standard-Normal-Ztable.pdf) we first we first must set our confidence level to some value between $0$ and $1$, let's call this value $a$. Then, we evaluate $\frac{1-a}{2}$. This is the probability that we must find on the inside of the Z table. When we've found the value that is closest to $\frac{1-a}{2}$, we find the corresponding critical value by following the row and column margins. 


## CIs for a population mean/expectation

### Find a critical value for a 95% CI in R 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
qt((1-0.95)/2, n-1)
```

### Find a critical value for a 95% CI in Excel 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
T.INV((1-0.95)/2, n-1)
```

### Find a critical value for a 95% CI from a table of probabilities 

Using a [t-distribution table](https://profsuzy.github.io/Stat11/t-distribution-table.pdf) we first must set our confidence level to some value between $0$ and $1$, let's call this value $a$. This is the probability (labeled as "A" in this table) that we must find at the top row of the t-distribution table. Second, we must find the degrees of freedom for our specific problem, i.e. $n-1$, along the first column. We then follow the row and collumn to find the corresponding critical t-value in the middle of the table.

# 1. Data Introduction 

The [in-class worksheet for this week](https://profsuzy.github.io/Stat11/wk10-wksheet.html) is related to two different data sets. The first data set consists of adults between ages $25$ and $30$ who were asked if they had graduated from high school. The second data set we will work with is data from experiments in 1882 that attempted to measure the speed of light.

# 2. Analysis Goal  

The purpose of these exercises is to practice working with confidence intervals for proportions and means. Specifically, these questions allow us to explore the role of the <span style="color:green">margin of error</span>, which can help us plan for future studies, and encourage us to think about the actual meaning of a confidence interval. 


# 3. Summary of Results  

* There is a trade-off between certainty and precision with confidence intervals. For higher level confidence intervals, we either need a larger margin of error (i.e. a wider interval) or larger sample sizes. 

* A confidence interval has an empirical interpretation related to (often) hypothetical replications of the study from which the data is drawn.
