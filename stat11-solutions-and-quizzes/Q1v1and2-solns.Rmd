I. This model can correctly predict the profit for $72\%$ of companies. 

II. On average, about $72\%$ of a company's profit results from advertising. 

III. On average, companies spend about $72\%$ of their profits on advertising.


**V1)** A

**V2)** E

Customers who purchased the items were asked to fill out an online comment survey giving $10\%$ off the next purchase. The data are summarized in the table below. What percentage of customers were at least satisfied with the item(s) purchased (Satisfied or Very satisfied)?

| Response | Frequency | 
| --- | --- |
| Very satisfied | 15 |
| Satisfied | 30 |
| Less than fully satisfied | 12 |
| Not satisfied | 4 |

**8.**  A small independent organic food store offers a variety of specialty coffees. To determine whether price has an impact on sales, the managers kept track of how many pounds of each variety of coffee were sold last month. Which of the following statements is incorrect?

# Part 2: Fill in the blank (4 points each)

**9.** A regional survey was carried out to gauge public opinion on an Arizona Immigration Law. Based on the results shown below, $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ percent of the public oppose the law. 

**V1)** $(60+45+85)/(50+93+35+85+45+60+5+7+20)=0.475$

| Response | Democrat | Republican | Independent | 
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Favor | 50 | 93 | 35 |
| Oppose | 85 | 45 | 60 | 
| Don't know | 5 | 7 | 20 | 

**V2)** $(55+45+85)/(49+92+35+85+45+55+6+8+20)=0.468$

| Response | Democrat | Republican | Independent | 
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Favor | 49 | 92 | 35 |
| Oppose | 85 | 45 | 55 | 
| Don't know | 6 | 8 | 20 |

**V1)** *Ace* is the dealer with the smallest price range of approximately $10,000$ dollars.  

**V2)** *BuyIt* is the dealer with the largest price range of approximately $12,000$ dollars. 




# Part 3: Math "essay" questions (10 points each) 

*To receive full credit on each of the following questions you must show your work and/or explain your reasoning. This can include formulas, pictures, or written sentences.* 

**11.** Suppose the time it takes to process phone orders in a small flower shop is normally distributed with a 
mean of $X$ minutes and a standard deviation of $1$ minute. Use the 68/95/99.7 rule to approximate the probability that a randomly placed order takes the shop less than $Y$ minutes to prepare. 

**V1)** $X=6$, $Y=4$; $0.25$ 

**V2)** $X=5$, $Y=3$; $0.25$


**12.** Suppose a larger flower shop that caters to local businesses and local government for large events also record the amount of time it takes to process and complete same-day phone orders. If their processing time is normally distributed with a mean of $X$ hours and a standard deviation of $0.5$ hours, then there's a $16\%$ chance that a random same-day phone order will take at least how long to prepare (in hours)? Use the 68/95/99.7 rule to approximate your answer. 

**V1)** $X=2$; $1.5$ hours 

**V2)** $X=1.9$; $1.4$ hours  


**13.** Last Valentine's Day, the small flower shop prepared a phone order in a record time of $X$ minutes. The large flower shop also broke a record for a same-day phone order that was completed in $Y$ hours. Determine which shop we are *statistically* most impressed by by comparing the z-scores for each of the record times. 

**V1)** $X=2.9$, $Y=0.55$; small shop 

**V2)** $X=1.9$, $Y=0.45$; small shop 


**You must use the z-table to answer questions 14 and 15 below. Note that there are two sides to this table.**


**14.** Find each of the z-scores from Question 13 on the Z-table by following the vertical and horizontal margins of the table to the closest possible values. The numbers in the middle of the table show the lower tailed probabilities corresponding to these two Standard Normal quantiles. What is the larger of these two probabilities? (Your answer should be a number from the z-table. To show your work, report both probabilities and circle the larger one.) 

**V1)** $0.001$, $0.0019$

**V2)** $0.001$, $0.0019$ 

**15.** In the middle of the z-table, find the lower tailed probability of $0.9505$. Find the values at the row and column margins of this probability; this is the lower-tailed $95.05$ quantile. Using this Standard Normal quantile, find the $95.05$ quantile of the small flower shop's phone order processing time (in minutes).  

**V1)**  $1.65 = \frac{x-6}{1}$, so $x=7.65$ minutes

**V2)**  $1.65 = \frac{x-5}{1}$, so $x=6.65$ minutes
