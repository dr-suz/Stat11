\vspace{.5cm}

(b) The linear model is okay because the association between the two variables is fairly strong.

**10.** A company's manufacturing process uses hundreds of gallons of water at a time while a "scrubbing" machine removes most of a chemical pollutant before pumping the water into a nearby lake. To meet federal regulations imposed through heavy fines, the company sets the machine to attain an average of 75 ppm in the treated water. The machine's output can be described by a normal model with standard deviation 5 ppm.

**11.** Recently, a regional survey was carried out to gauge public opinion on a controversial Arizona Immigration Law. 

\vspace{.25cm}

The results below indicate that approximately $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ percent of the public in Arizona favor the law. (Hint: There's no need to simplify your work, just writing out the formula to calculate will suffice.)

| Response | Democrat | Republican | Independent | 
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Favor | 50 | 93 | 35 |
| Oppose | 85 | 45 | 60 |

**12.** Based on data collected from its production processes, Crosstiles Inc. determines that the breaking strength of its most popular porcelain tile is normally distributed with a mean of $400$ pounds per square inch and a standard deviation of $10$ pounds per square inch. Based on the 68-95-99.7 Rule, about 

\vspace{.25cm} $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ percent of the popular porcelain tile will have breaking strengths between 370 and 420 pounds per square inch. (Hint: Draw a Normal curve and label the mean and one/two/three standard deviations away from the mean.)

**13.** The boxplots show prices of used cars (in thousands of dollars) advertised for sale at three different car dealers. 

![](./images/Q1_boxplots2.png){height=3.5in}

\vspace{0.25cm}

$\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ is the dealer with the smallest price range of approximately $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ dollars.

**14.** At a local manufacturing plant, employees must complete new machine set ups within $30$ minutes. Suppose new machine set-up times can be described by a normal model with a mean of $22$ minutes and a standard deviation of $4$ minutes. 

\vspace{.25cm}

$\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ percent of new machine set ups take $30$ minutes or more. 


\vspace{.5cm}

**15.** Suppose the time it takes to process phone orders in a small florist/gift shop is normally distributed with a mean of 6 minutes and a standard deviation of 1 minute. 

\vspace{.25cm} 

An order that processes in $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ minutes separates the $5\%$ of orders that take the most time to process from the rest of the quicker $95\%$ of orders.

**17.** Most likely, in a simple linear regression model for this data, $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ is the predictor variable 

\vspace{.25cm} 

and $\rule{3cm}{0.15mm}$ is the response variable. 



*Data were collected on monthly sales revenues (in \$1,000s) and monthly advertising expenditures (\$100s) for a sample of drug stores. The regression line relating revenues $(Y)$ to advertising expenditure $(X)$ is estimated to be $\hat{y}_{i} = -48.3 + 9.00x_i$.*
