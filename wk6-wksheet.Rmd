**Instructions:** There are X parts to this worksheet. First, work on the X questions. Then, when instructed by your professor, get into groups to discuss your answers to Part X and move on to complete Part X. Before getting started however, take a moment and reflect on ways in which you can show your assigned group members respect. You may also view this initial [list of examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1emP8SiS2IO-_blKdVmVp-CJTr0NLlKG4vzMnphH-P7E/edit?usp=sharing) that we will add to over the semester.

**Briefly,** in the space below, specify one way in which you will work to show your group members respect during today's lesson:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
require(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE) # include this if you don't want markdown to knit messages
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE) # include this if you don't want markdown to knit warnings
```


**Instructions:** Let's plan a trip. Suppose $8$ of us are going to travel to attend one of two international statistics conferences. (The rest of us are attending non-statistical conferences, naturally.) We need to request funding so we can travel to and from our destinations. Suppose $3$ of us are flying to Toronto, Canada for the 2023 Joint Statistical Meeting and $5$ of us are flying to the International Chinese Statistical Association conference in Chengdu, China.  

Airline ticket prices vary from time to time, but for simplicity, let's assume we're going to purchase all tickets for the same destination at the same price. Suppose also that past experience has shown that tickets to Toronto have a mean price of $\$400$, with a standard deviation of $\$70$, while the mean airfare to Chengdu is $\$1000$, with a standard deviation of $\$150$.


# 1. 
Define random variables and use them to express the total amount we will need to request to fund the trip to both of these destinations.

<br>


# 2. 
Find the mean and standard deviation of the total cost of the one-way-trip to our destinations. Do we need to make any assumptions in calculating these means? How about in calculating the standard deviations?

# 3. 
Suppose we pick a student from our class at random (in both sections combined there are $54$ students). Draw a tree diagram to show how to calculate the probability that this randomly selected student is going to a statistics conference and is traveling to Toronto this summer.

***
For Problems 4 and 5, consider the two probabilities given and consider the possible answers:

*	Probability (a) is greater than probability (b).

*	Probability b is greater than probability (a).

*	The two probabilities are equal.

*	It is impossible to tell. 

Select the correct answer for each problem and explain how you know this. 


# 4.  
(a) The probability that the cost of your flight is partially refunded and your luggage is lost. 

(b) The probability that the cost of your flights is partially refunded given that your luggage is lost.

# 5. 
(a) The probability that a randomly selected Swarthmore student wants to go to a statistics conference. 

(b) The probability that a randomly selected Swarthmore student is a statistics major and wants to go to a statistics conference.
