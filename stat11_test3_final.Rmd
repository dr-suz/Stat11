**Instructions:** The first part of this test is multiple choice questions that do not require any additional explanation or work. No extra work will be considered in the grading of these questions but you can get partial credit for many of these questions as some answers may be better than others. For each of the multiple choice questions, base your choice off of which answer you think is the best or most appropriate. The last part of this test is free response questions. For these questions, you must show all your work and/or provide enough justification and explain your reasoning in order to get full credit or be considered for partial credit.  

**Take a deep breath.** 
\vspace{2mm}

**Test organization:** There are $25$ questions in total on this test and they are organized into three subsections: Section 1 contains  20 multiple choice or matching questions (the first 10 are worth 2 points and the last 10 are worth 4 points), Section 2 contains 5 free-response questions (each is worth 6 points), Section 3 contains two  extra credit opportunities. If you need additional paper you may come to the front of the class and pick some up. The problems within each section are roughly organized by increasing level of difficulty.

You have prepared for this test and with a clear and well-rested mind, you are ready to show me what you have learned this semester. As with the previous tests, the purpose of this exam is to measure your understanding of the material we have covered. This is nothing more than a metric for your professor to evaluate your preparedness to think statistically at this particular moment in time and in this particular setting. This is not a perfect measure of your knowledge and does not predict your future statistical skills. 


**Take a deep breath, once more.**

**9.** Suppose Ell conducts a hypothesis test to determine whether or not there is a statistically discernible difference in the average life span of field mice, $\mu_{f}$, and city mice, $\mu_{c}$ (measured in months). 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='c', fig.height=3}
#shade_under_curve(p, distdata, right=qnorm(0.025, mean_, sd_, lower.tail=FALSE), distrib=dnorm, mean=mean_, sd=sd_, fill = "red")

  labs(title="Sampling distribution of the difference in means") + 
  xlab(" ") + ylab(" ") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
```

The plot above represents the theoretical sampling distribution of the difference in sample means, $\bar{X}_{f} - \bar{X}_{c}$, under the null hypothesis.

**10.**  Suppose Freddy is also interested in testing for a difference in the average life span of field mice, $\mu_{f}$, and city mice, $\mu_{c}$ and Freddy collects another random sample of the same size and sets an $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='c', fig.height=3}
#shade_under_curve(p, distdata, right=qnorm(0.025, mean_, sd_, lower.tail=FALSE), distrib=dnorm, mean=mean_, sd=sd_, fill = "red")  
p2 = shade_under_curve(p, distdata, left=qnorm(0.05/2, mean_, sd_), distrib=dnorm, mean=mean_, sd=sd_, fill = "blue") 
shade_under_curve(p2, distdata, right=qnorm(1-0.05/2, mean_, sd_), distrib=dnorm, mean=mean_, sd=sd_, fill = "blue") + 
  labs(title="Sampling distribution of the difference in means") + 
  xlab(" ") + ylab(" ") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
```

If the area under the curve in the plot above is equal to $0.05/2 = 0.025$, then which of the following observed differences in means would lead Freddy to reject the null in favor of the alternative? **Circle all that apply.**

You do not need to write in complete sentences but your answers must be clear and legible to receive full credit.  


**21.** An internet company is planning to test which of two online ad campaigns is more effective in generating clicks on their site. Suppose you are hired to conduct this test. Address the following questions.

For questions 22 and 23 consider the following scenario:

Anthropologists have found two burial mounds in the same region. They know several tribes lived in the region and that the tribes have been reliably classified according to different lengths of skulls. They measure a random sample of $50$ skulls from each burial mound and want to determine if the two mounds correspond to different tribes. Suppose they calculate a $95\%$ confidence interval for the difference in skull length to be between $0.056$in and $0.103$in and they calculate a p-value of $0.0082$. 

**22.** Explain the meaning of the confidence interval within the context of this problem.

**23.** Explain the meaning of the p-value within the context of this problem.

**24.** Your aunt tells you about a news report claiming that scientists found "evidence that time spent on social media increases the risk of depression by more than $80\%$". You look up the study and it turns out that a professor who coauthored the paper reporting this study works at a university near your aunt's home. Suppose you have arranged to meet with this professor the next time you're in town visiting your aunt. Outline 3-5 (realistic) steps you should take (either before, during, or after your meeting) to assess the reliability of the conclusions from the study.
