Math world (RV as a model) vs real world (observable sample data)

# What is a distribution? 

Possibilities and Probabilities 

## Recap: Normal/Gaussian Distribution 

## Examples 

Uniform

Chi-square 


For now, going to focus on numeric variables. 



# Comparing Distributions of Numeric Variables 

Five number summary 

Q: When to use the mean vs the median? When to use standard deviation vs IQR? 

Histograms or bar charts 

Grouped data displays 

## Quantiles and percentiles  

compare/contrast for std normal model, non-std normal, and binomial (or another continuous) model 

[draw pic highlight values for quantiles changed, 68/95/99.7]

Normal probability plots - plot each data point against it's z-score. Straight line means these values match up well and a Normal/Gaussian model is likely reasonable.
