**Instructions:** There are 5 questions in this worksheet. You will work with your group members to answer each question. Before getting started, take a moment and reflect on ways in which you can show your assigned group members respect. You may also view this initial [list of examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1emP8SiS2IO-_blKdVmVp-CJTr0NLlKG4vzMnphH-P7E/edit?usp=sharing) that we will add to over the semester.

**Briefly,** in the space below, specify one way in which you will work to show your group members respect during today's lesson:

<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
require(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE) # include this if you don't want markdown to knit messages
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE) # include this if you don't want markdown to knit warnings
```

Settings: 

* Mean(s) 

* Proportion(s)

* Observational study 

* Experiment 

Statistical inference techniques:

A. One-sample t-procedures for a mean.

B. Two-sample t-procedures for comparing means.

C. Paired-sample t-procedures.

D. One-sample z-procedures for a proportion.

E. Two-sample z-procedures for comparing proportions.

Inference methods: 

* Confidence interval: useful when we are interested in estimating an actual effect size.

* Hypothesis test: useful when we primarily need to make a decision. 


For each of the following research questions, identify (by letter) the procedure that you would use to investigate that question. (Note: assume no one-to-one correspondence between the methods and research questions.)

1. 

2. Health recommendations suggest walking 10,000 steps per day. Suppose that you collect data from a sample of Fitbit users and you want to test if they average more than 10000 steps per day. (one-sided test)

3. Are people who own a pet bird more likely to suffer from lung cancer than people who do not own a pet bird? (one-sided test)

4. The manager of a companyâ€™s human resource department examines employee attendance records to investigate whether more than 20% of employee sick days are taken on Fridays.  (one-sided test)

5.  

6.  

7. Do cows tend to produce more milk if their handler speaks to them by name every day than if the handler does not speak to them by name? A farmer randomly assigned half of her cows to each group and then compared how much milk they produced after one month. (one-sided test)

8. A recent survey investigated whether American adults who have children are significantly more likely to play video games than American adults who do not have children. (one-sided test)

9. A researcher is interested in studying whether Americans gained weight, on average, while in quarantine by virtue of the COVID-19 pandemic. She took a random sample of Americans and asked their weight before the pandemic, and their weight in mid-2021 (after quarantine, hopefully).   (one-sided test)

10. Do male science teachers tend to receive higher salaries than female science teachers?  (one-sided test)
