**21.** Vending machines on a college campus offer a variety of snacks. The purchasing agent believes that each type of snack is equally preferred by students and consequently orders equal quantities. The number of snacks sold from vending machines on this campus for the last six months is shown in the following table. 

| Snack Type | Chips | Candy Bars | Crackers | Nuts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Purchase Frequency | 159 | 198 | 174 | 149 | 


The observed test statistic for determining if the purchasing agent's belief is supported is

$\chi^2 = 8.012$.

**22.**  A manufacturing process has a $70\%$ yield, meaning that $70\%$ of the products are acceptable and $30\%$ are defective.

**23.** A professor divided the students in her business class into three groups: those who have never taken a statistics class, those who have taken only one semester of a statistics class, and those who have taken two or more semesters of statistics. The professor randomly assigns students to groups of three to work on a project for the course. 

If $35\%$ of the students have never taken a statistics class, $25\%$ have taken only one semester of a statistics class, and the rest have taken two or more semesters of statistics, then the probability that neither of the first two

\vspace{1cm}
groupmates you meet has studied any statistics is $0.123$ .

\vspace{1cm}
will be centered at $4.8$ and have a margin of error equal to $3$.
