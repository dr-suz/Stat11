# Recall 

Random phenomena are often modeled as random variables. Random variables are mathematical objects that have an associated probability distribution function. 

A probability distribution must always specify:

* possibilities 

* probabilities 
  
# 1. Expected value 

sum of all possibilities times their corresponding probabilities 
  
$$E(X) = \sum x \times Pr(x)$$   
  
# 2. Variance and standard deviation  

approximate average (squared) distance of each possible value from the mean (expected value) times the corresponding probabilities 

$$Var(X) = \sum (x-E(X))^2\times Pr(x)$$ 

square root of the variance 



## Correlation and Covariance 


Correlation and covariance measure the same thing: strength of a linear trend between two random variables 

Correlation is a standardized version of covariance, always between -1 and 1 

$$Cov(X,Y) = E\left[(X-E(X))\cdot(Y-E(Y)) \right]$$

  
# 3. Linear transformations of a random Variable 

$$E(aX) = aE(X), \quad E(a \pm X) = a \pm E(X)$$

$$Var(aX) = a^2 Var(X), \quad Var(a + X) = Var(X)$$
