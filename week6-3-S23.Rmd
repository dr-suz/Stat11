# 1. Data Introduction 

We are going to use the laws of probability and properties of random variables to plan a trip. We will warm up by considering how conditional probabilities differ from marginal probabilities.

# 2. Analysis Goal  

Ultimately, the goal of this analysis is the estimate the cost to fly several of us across the globe for a statistics conference. We will do this by using random variables to model the airline ticket prices of two different destinations.

# 3. Summary of Results  

* It's not easy to predict the outcome of a random phenomena but the mean and standard deviation are helpful in this regard. 

* Consider two **independent** random variables, $X$ and $Y$. Suppose the theoretical mean and standard deviation of $X$ are $E(X)$ and $\sqrt{Var(X)}$, respectively. Suppose something similar holds for $Y$. We can consider a new random variable $W = X + Y$ and compute it's theoretical mean and standard deviation using the fact that

$$E(W) = E(X) + E(Y), \quad\text{and } Var(W) = Var(X) + Var(Y).$$
