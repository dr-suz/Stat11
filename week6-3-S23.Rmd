# 1. Data Introduction 

We are going to use the laws of probability and properties of random variables to plan a trip. We will warm up by considering how conditional probabilities differ from marginal probabilities.

# 2. Analysis Goal  

Ultimately, the goal of this analysis is the estimate the cost to fly several of us across the globe for a statistics conference. We will do this by using random variables to model the airline ticket prices of two different destinations.

# 3. Summary of Results  

* It's not easy to predict the outcome of a random phenomena but the mean and standard deviation are helpful in this regard. 

* Consider two **independent** random variables, $X$ and $Y$. Suppose the theoretical mean and standard deviation of $X$ are $E(X)$ and $\sqrt{Var(X)}$, respectively. Suppose something similar holds for $Y$. We can consider a new random variable $W = X + Y$ and compute it's theoretical mean and standard deviation using the fact that

$$E(W) = E(X) + E(Y), \quad\text{and } Var(W) = Var(X) + Var(Y).$$

## Solutions to Part 3

**4. Define two random variables and use them to express the total amount of funding we will need to request to fly to both of these statistics conferences.**

<br>
<br>

One possible solution is to let $X$ represent the random cost of an airline ticket from Philadelphia to Toronto, and let $Y$ represent the random cost of an airline ticket from Philadelphia to Chengdu: 

$$X = \text{ cost of a flight from Philadelphia to Toronto} \\ Y = \text{ cost of a flight from Philadelphia to Chendu}$$

Then, according to the information above, we have that 

$$E(X) = 563, \quad Var(X) = 70^2 \\ E(Y) = 5400, \quad Var(Y) = 750^2.$$


We can model the total cost of airfare to and from these conferences as a function of these two random variables: $2(3X + 5Y)$.

**5. Find the expected value and standard deviation of the cost of the one-way-trip to get all students to their destinations. Do we need to make any assumptions in calculating these means or standard deviations?**


$$E(3X + 5Y) =  E(3X) + E(5Y) = 3 E(X) + 5 E(Y) =  3(563) + 5(5400) = 28,689 \text{ dollars}$$
$$Var(3X + 5Y) =  Var(3X) + Var(5Y) = 3^2 Var(X) + 5^2 Var(Y) =  9(70^2) + 25(750^2) = 14,106,600 \text{ dollars}^2$$
$$sd(3X+5Y) = \sqrt{14,106,600} = 4,755.88 \text{ dollars}$$ 
Variance formula assumes $Cov(X,Y)=0$.
