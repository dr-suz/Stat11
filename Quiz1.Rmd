**X.** A company's manufacturing process uses 500 gallons of water at a time. A "scrubbing" machine then removes most of a chemical pollutant before pumping the water into a nearby lake. To meet federal regulations the treated water must not contain more than 80 parts per million (ppm) of the chemical. Because a fine is charged if regulations are not met, the company sets the machine to attain an average of 75 ppm in the treated water. The machine's output can be described by a normal model with standard deviation 4.2 ppm. What percent of the batches of water discharged exceed the 80 ppm standard?

(a) $3.89\%$ 

(b) $11.7\%$ 

(c) $8.83\%$ 

(d) $1.17\%$ 

(e) $88.3\%$

(a) $32\%$

(b) $68\%$  

(c) $84\%$ 

(d) $47.5\%$ 

(e) $95\%$

**X.** The residuals plot for a linear model is shown. Which is TRUE? 

![](stat11/images/Q1_residuals.png)

(a) The linear model is no good since some residuals are large. 

(b) The linear model is okay because the association between the two variables is fairly strong.

(c) The linear model is no good since the correlation is near 0.

(d) The linear model is okay because approximately the same number of points are above the line as below it.

(e) The linear model is no good because of the curve in the residuals.
