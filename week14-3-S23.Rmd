# 1. Data Introduction 

The [in-class worksheet for this week](https://profsuzy.github.io/Stat11/wk14-wksheet.html) is all about practicing statistical inference for categorical variables! 

Recall we have learned the following procedures: 

* Chi-square goodness of fit 

  * $H_0: p_{1} = p_{1,0}, p_{2} = p_{2,0}, p_{3} = p_{3,0}, \dots, p_{k} = p_{k,0}$

  * Example: Does the distribution of beak types for finches on the San Cristobal island match the distribution of beak types for finches on the Pinta island. On Pinta island $56\%$ of the finches have the first beak types, $30\%$ of the finches have the second beak types, $7\%$ have the third type, and $7\%$ have the fourth type.

* Chi-square test of homogeneity 

  * $H_0: p_{1} = p_{2} = p_{3} =  \cdots = p_{k}$

  * Example: Are all the flavors of jelly beans evenly distributed in the packages sold at a supermarket? 

* Chi-square test of independence 

  * $H_0:$ Categorical variable $X$ is independent of categorical variable $Y$. 

  * Example: Is whether or not a person aboard the Titanic survived independent of their class status? 

# 2. Analysis Goals  

* Recognize whether or not a statistical question involves count data. 

* Determine which chi-square procedure is appropriate for different inference questions about count data. 


# 3. Summary of Results  

* Just because some data can be presented in tabular format doesn't mean that it is count data! 

* Although the format of the null and alternative hypotheses are standard for each procedure, translating these statements about population parameters into a particular applied context takes careful thought. 

# Reflection 

Let's take a minute to review our previous in-class worksheets.
