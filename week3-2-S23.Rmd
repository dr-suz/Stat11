# 1. Analyzing Two Numeric Variables


## Scatterplots 

When viewing a scatterplot, we are looking for different types of association present between at least two numeric variables. Descriptions of an association between two numeric variables should mention:

- Direction, 

- Form, and  

- Strength.

## Correlation 

If the association/relationship between two numeric variables seems to follow a linear trend, then we can describe the strength of the linear trend with the <span style="color:green">sample correlation</span> (or correlation coefficient).


<span style="color:purple">Can we still report the correlation if the relationship between the two variables is **not** linear?</span>

# 2. Modeling Two Numeric Variables with the Line of Best Fit 


## Sum of squares notation

$$s_x = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \quad s_x = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2, \quad s_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$$

least squares model coefficients 

$$b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}\quad\text{and}\quad b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$$
slope will change from one sample to the next; changes in one unit of $x$ associated with changes of $b_1$ units in $y$ 

$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$$

## Assessing the residuals 

$$\text{Residual} = e = y - \hat{y} = \text{observed value} - \text{predicted value}$$

standard deviation of the residuals
$$s_e = \frac{\sum e^2 }{n-1}$$

Normal model (and 68-95-99.7 rule) applies when assumptions are reasonable


# 3. Summary Statistics for Simple Linear Regression


## Slope 

## Correlation coefficient 

is the number of std devs by which one variable is expected to change for a one standard deviation change in the other 

is unitless 

will change from one sample to the next 

For a sample of size $n$, with a numeric variable $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$, and another numeric variable, $(y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n)$, we can calculate the sample correlation by finding:
$$r = \frac{s_{xy}}{\sqrt{s_x s_y}}.$$

## Coefficient of determination 

is the square of the correlation coefficient 

is the fraction/proportion of the variation/variability in $y$ accounted for by a linear model of $x$ 

reflects the successfullness of the model at relating $y$ to $x$ (goodness of fit measure)

For simple linear regression: $R^2 = r^2$

# 4. Assumptions Behind a Simple Linear Model

- linear enough 

- no thickening or thinning of the scatterplot when read from left to right 

- no outliers
