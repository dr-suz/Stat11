# 1. Analyzing Two Numeric Variables


## Scatterplots 

![](./images/foot and height.png)

Association

- Direction 

- Form 

- Strength 


## Correlation 

If the association/relationship between two numeric variables seems to follow a linear trend, then we can describe the strength of the linear trend with the <span style="color:green">sample correlation</span> (or correlation coefficient).

<span style="color:purple">Can we still report the correlation if the relationship between the two variables is **not** linear?</span>

# 2. Modeling Two Numeric Variables with the Line of Best Fit 

least squares model coefficients 

$$b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}\quad\text{and}\quad b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$$
slope will change from one sample to the next; changes in one unit of $x$ associated with changes of $b_1$ units in $y$ 

$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$$

## Assessing the residuals 

$$\text{Residual} = e = y - \hat{y} = \text{observed value} - \text{predicted value}$$

standard deviation of the residuals
$$s_e = \frac{\sum e^2 }{n-1}$$

Normal model (and 68-95-99.7 rule) applies when assumptions are reasonable


# 3. Summary Statistics for Simple Linear Regression


## Slope 

## Correlation coefficient 

is the number of std devs by which one variable is expected to change for a one standard deviation change in the other 

is unitless 

will change from one sample to the next 

## Coefficient of determination 

is the square of the correlation coefficient 

is the fraction/proportion of the variation/variability in $y$ accounted for by a linear model of $x$ 

reflects the successfullness of the model at relating $y$ to $x$ (goodness of fit measure)

# 4. Assumptions Behind a Simple Linear Model

- linear enough 

- no thickening or thinning of the scatterplot when read from left to right 

- no outliers
