# 1. Paired t-test 


# 2. Effect size 



# 3. Blocking  


# 4. Error rates and power 

The only way to reduce both types of error is to collect more evidence or, in statistical terms, to collect more data.

* $\alpha = Pr(\text{Type I error})$: If $H_0$ is true, this is the probability that we (incorrectly) reject it.

* $\beta = Pr(\text{Type II error})$: If $H_0$ is false, this is the probability that we (incorrectly) fail to reject it. 

* $1-\beta = Power$ If $H_0$ is false, this is the probability that we (correctly) reject it.
