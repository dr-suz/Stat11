**Instructions:** Wildlife researchers are monitoring a Florida alligator population by taking areal photographs and attempting to estimate the weights of the gators based on the length of the gators in the images. The data set `Gators.csv` contains the variables `Length` and `Weight` for a sample of alligators who have been captured and studied. This data is shown in the scatterplot below. Import the `Gators` data set into either Excel or RStudio and then answer the following questions. 
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
gators <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProfSuzy/Stat11/main/Data/Gators.csv")

ggplot(gators, aes(x=Weight, y=Length)) +
  geom_scatter()
```
