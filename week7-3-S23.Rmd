# Recap

## Example 3 - Week 6 In-Class Worksheet: Part 2 

Assume tickets to Toronto have a mean price of $\$563$, with a standard deviation of $\$70$, while the mean airfare to Chengdu is $\$5400$, with a standard deviation of $\$750$.

Let $X = \text{ the cost of a flight from PHL to Toronto}$ and $Y = \text{ the cost of a flight from PHL to Chengdu}$. Then the total cost of airfare to these conferences is: $3X + 5Y$.

<br>

<span style="color:purple">5. Find the expected value and standard deviation of the total cost of the one-way-trip to our destinations. Do we need to make any assumptions in calculating these means or standard deviations?</span>



# 1. Data Introduction 

Candy company claims that they produce and randomly package Jelly Beans of which $10\%$ are licorice flavored. 

## Binomial distribution

Random variable $X \sim Binom(n,p)$

$E(X) = np, \quad Var(X) = np(1-p)$

Model parameter: $p=$ proportion of licorice candies 


Sample estimate(s): $\hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of licorice candies}}{n}$ 

Sample size: $n=25$ 





# 2. Analysis Goal  


Calculate expectation and variance. Characterize extreme outcomes. 

For binomial model, calculate probability of X or more.

# 3. Summary of Results  

* Use the fact that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ approximately fits a Normal distribution. Binomial distribution and Normal approximation.
