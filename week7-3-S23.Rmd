# Recap

## Example 3 - Week 6 In-Class Worksheet: Part 2 

Assume tickets to Toronto have a mean price of $\$563$, with a standard deviation of $\$70$, while the mean airfare to Chengdu is $\$5400$, with a standard deviation of $\$750$.

Let $X = \text{ the cost of a flight from PHL to Toronto}$ and $Y = \text{ the cost of a flight from PHL to Chengdu}$. Then the total cost of airfare to these conferences is: $3X + 5Y$.

<span style="color:purple">Find the expected value and standard deviation of the total cost of the one-way-trip to our destinations. Do we need to make any assumptions in calculating these means or standard deviations?</span>

# 1. Data Introduction 

There are 50 different flavored candies in a large bag of 1300 candy beans. Eight of these flavors are green colored. According to the company's website, $15\%$ of the candies in any given package are green.

You are going to collect a random sample of these candies and evaluate the company's claim that $15\%$ are green. Along the way, you are going to practice finding probabilities using a [Binomial table of probabilities](https://uwf.edu/media/university-of-west-florida/colleges/cse/departments/mathematics-and-statistics/documents/student-resources/Binomial-Tables-1.pdf) and a [Normal (Z) table of probabilities](https://qcenter.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/764/2018/05/Standard-Normal-Ztable.pdf). 


# 2. Analysis Goal  

One goal of this exercise is to explore features of the binomial probability distribution and eventually, to see how a Normal probability distribution can approximate a binomial distribution for a large enough sample size. The other goal is to use the expectation and standard deviation of random variables to characterize whether or not the observed proportions in a sample match up with the claims about the package contents from the candy company.

# 3. Summary of Results  

* Binomial probability distribution:

Random variable $X \sim Binom(n,p)$ and $E(X) = np, \quad Var(X) = np(1-p)$. The model parameter is $p=$ proportion of successes.  

From a sample of size $n$, we can derive the sample estimate $\hat{p} = \frac{\text{number of green candies}}{n}$. 

* Normal approximation to the binomial distribution: 

If $n$ is large enough, then $X \approx N(\mu = np, \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)})$.
