# Recap

## Example 3 - Week 6 In-Class Worksheet: Part 2 

Assume tickets to Toronto have a mean price of $\$563$, with a standard deviation of $\$70$, while the mean airfare to Chengdu is $\$5400$, with a standard deviation of $\$750$.

Let $X = \text{ the cost of a flight from PHL to Toronto}$ and $Y = \text{ the cost of a flight from PHL to Chengdu}$. Then the total cost of airfare to these conferences is: $3X + 5Y$.

<br>

<span style="color:purple">5. Find the expected value and standard deviation of the total cost of the one-way-trip to our destinations. Do we need to make any assumptions in calculating these means or standard deviations?</span>



# 1. Data Introduction 


## Binomial distribution


Model parameter(s): 

Sample estimate(s): 



# 2. Analysis Goal  

Use the fact that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ approximately fits a Normal distribution. 

Binomial distribution and Normal approximation. Calculate expectation and variance. Characterize extreme outcomes. 

For binomial model, calculate probability of X or more.
