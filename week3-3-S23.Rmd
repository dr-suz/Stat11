# 1. Data Introduction 

Wildlife researchers are monitoring a Florida alligator population by taking areal photographs and attempting to estimate the weights of the gators based on the length of the gators in the images. The data set `Gators.csv` contains the variables `Length` and `Weight` for a sample of alligators who have been captured and studied.

# 2. Analysis Goal  

We are going to design a simple linear regression model and then assess the model fit and interpretation. Click this link to view the [worksheet for this gator data analysis problem](https://profsuzy.github.io/Stat11/wk3-wksheet.html). 



# 3. Summary of Results 

* It's important to consider the roles of the explanatory variable and the response variable. 

* Just because R (or Excel) fits a line and gives us a slope and intercept doesn't mean that the model is appropriate or information. We must consider the assumptions for a SLR model:

  * the relationship between predictor and response is **linear enough** 

  * there is **no thickening or thinning** of the scatterplot when read from left to right 
  
  * there are **no outliers** 


Note, we have not yet had time in class to discuss the phenomena of *regression to the mean* or the issues posed by *lurking variables*. You are still responsible for understanding this material. (These might be good topics for us to cover during the review days before Quiz 1.)
