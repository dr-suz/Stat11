# 1. Data Introduction 

Wildlife researchers are monitoring a Florida alligator population by taking areal photographs and attempting to estimate the weights of the gators based on the length of the gators in the images. The data set `Gators.csv` contains the variables `Length` and `Weight` for a sample of alligators who have been captured and studied.

# 2. Analysis Goal  

We are going to design a simple linear regression model and then assess the model fit and interpretation. Click this link to the [worksheet for this gator data analysis problem](https://profsuzy.github.io/Stat11/wk3-wksheet.html). 



# 3. Summary of Results 

* It's important to consider the roles of the explanatory variable and the response variable. 

* Just because R (or Excel) fits a line and gives us a slope and intercept doesn't mean that the model is appropriate or information.

## Assumptions Behind a Simple Linear Model

- linear enough 

- no thickening or thinning of the scatterplot when read from left to right 

- no outliers 



## Transforming/Re-expressing data

in addition to shifts and scales... 

root, exponents, natural logs 


Explanatory variable and response variable 

Lurking variables 

## Regression to the mean 

b/c correlation is between -1 and 1, each predicted response tends to be closer (in standard deviations) to the mean of $y$ than the corresponding value of the explanatory variable was from $\bar{x}$ 

can occur when two variables measure similar, correlated things (?)
