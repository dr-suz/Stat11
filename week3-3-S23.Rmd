# 1. Data Introduction 

Wildlife researchers are monitoring a Florida alligator population by taking areal photographs and attempting to estimate the weights of the gators based on the length of the gators in the images. The data set `Gators.csv` contains the variables `Length` and `Weight` for a sample of alligators who have been captured and studied.

# 2. Analysis Goal  

We are going to design a simple linear regression model and then assess the model fit and interpretation. 



# 3. Summary of Results 

* It's important to consider the roles of the explanatory variable and the response variable. 

* Just because R (or Excel) fits a line and gives us a slope and intercept doesn't mean that the model is appropriate or information.
