# Main Ideas 

* Examine part (sample) of the whole (population)

* Randomize to avoid bias 

* Sample size need not be relative to population size

**Important:** Random $\neq$ Arbitrary 

# 3. Practical Sampling Designs 

**Goal:** Representative and (somehow) random sample 

* Stratified random sampling

* Cluster and multistage sampling 

* Systematic sampling
