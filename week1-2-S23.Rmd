Ways to exploring and describing data 

data vs stories 

Brene Brown quote: "stories are data with a soul" 

# 1. How to explore numeric (or quantitative) data?  

histograms, bin size, what are we looking for? what's the story? 

boxplot, interpretation, what's the difference between this and a histogram? 

stem and leaf plot

time plots 

outliers 

transformations/re-expressions 


# 2. How to explore categorical data?  

tables of counts or proportions 

bar charts 

pie chart 

Contingency table examples (Ch 3)


# 3. How to explore relationships among multiple variables? 

What does the word "relationship" entail in a statistical or data science context? (compare/contrast human relationships with variable relationships)


scatterplots, correlation not causation

stacked boxplots 

stacked bar charts
