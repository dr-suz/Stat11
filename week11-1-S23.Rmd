# 1. Complete Week 10 worksheet 

mention what to do if don't have historical info for proportions (use $\hat{p}=0.5$)

# 2. Introduce hypothesis tests 

Show new reference sheet 

$$H_0: \text{null hypothesis} \quad H_A: \text{alternative hypothesis}$$ 
$H_0$ specifies the entire sampling distribution of our sample estimate! 

Different types of $H_A$. Still choose you confidence level! The value $(1-a)$ is called the <span style="color:green">significance</span> level. Statistical significance is not the same thing as colloquial or practical significance. 


Output of a test is called a $p-$value. This is a conditional probability, the probability of the $\hat{p}$ or $\bar{x}$ value from you data or something even more rare occurring based on the sampling distribution of your estimator conditioned upon the assumption that $H_0$ is true and you actually know the exact sampling distribution. 

Assumptions - same as in CIs 

standard error (still for tests about population means) but actually have standard deviation for tests of population proportions
